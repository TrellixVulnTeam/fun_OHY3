EV_12b	Alice planted one radish seed in each of 5 separate pots (Pot one, Pot 2, Pot 3, Pot 4 and Pot 5). She used the same amount and the same kind of soil in each pot. She put them by the same window. The first graph shows the amount of water she put into each pot every day (Pot one got 5 milliliters, Pot 2 got 10 milliliters, Pot 3 got 15 milliliters, Pot 4 got 20 milliliters, and Pot 5 got 25 milliliters). The second graph shows the length of each root after 7 days (0 centimeters for Pot one, 4 centimeters for Pot 2, 8 centimeters for Pot 3, 5 centimeters for Pot 4, and 0 centimeters for Pot 5). What is the range of tolerance for water for these radish seeds? Explain how you decided the range of tolerance.	10 milliliters to 20 milliliters. The radishes did not grow at all in pots one and 5 so the range of tolerance is for pots 2, 3 and 4, which got 10 to 20 milliliters of water.	EV.12b.102.1	0 to 25 milliliters, 0 to 25 milliliters because the plants all grew from 0 to 25 milliliters of water.	incorrect

The first graph shows the amount of water she put into each pot every day (Pot one got 5 milliliters, Pot 2 got 10 milliliters, Pot 3 got 15 milliliters, Pot 4 got 20 milliliters, and Pot 5 got 25 milliliters). The second graph shows the length of each root after 7 days (0 centimeters for Pot one, 4 centimeters for Pot 2, 8 centimeters for Pot 3, 5 centimeters for Pot 4, and 0 centimeters for Pot 5). What is the range of tolerance for water for these radish seeds? Explain how you decided the range of tolerance.	10 milliliters to 20 milliliters. The radishes did not grow at all in pots one and 5 so the range of tolerance is for pots 2, 3 and 4, which got 10 to 20 milliliters of water.	EV.12b.432.1	20 milliliters, To find the range you have got to take the lowest amount of water and subtract that from the highest amount of water. If the highest amount is 25 milliliters and the lowest is 5 milliliters you have got to do 25 minus 5 equals 20 milliliters. So 20 milliliters is the range.	incorrect
