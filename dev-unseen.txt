MX_49	Beth made 2 solutions of different concentrations of water and citric acid. She put 50 milliliters of the first solution in cup X and 50 milliliters of the second solution in cup Y. When she put the cups on the balance, the balance looked as shown below. Which solution, X or Y, is more concentrated? Explain how you know which is more concentrated.	X. When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	MX.49.385.1	X, cup x is a lot more concentrated because x is more heavy.		correct
SE_46	Amber predicted that a black covered box would heat up faster than a white covered box. She took 2 identical shoe boxes and wrapped one with white paper and the other with black paper. She punched a hole in each box, stuck a thermometer into each hole, and put both boxes in the sun. Every 5 minutes, Amber recorded the temperature in each box. Will the data support Amber's prediction? Explain your answer.	Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.	SE.46.605.1	Yes. Yes, because black absorbs heat from the sun.	correct
MS_64a	Greta used her hand to measure the length of the whiteboard in her classroom. She found that it was 14 hands long. Andre measured the whiteboard and found that it was 16 hands long. Explain why Greta and Andre got different measurements.	Greta and Andre have different sized hands.	MS.64a.459.1	Because they are older than the other and their hand have different hands, or one of them opened their finger and the other did not.	correct
ME_69b	A magnet attracted another magnet even when a foam block was placed between them (see box A below). What do you think would happen if 2 foam blocks were placed between the 2 magnets (see box B). A. The magnets will stick. B. The magnets will not stick. (C. It might stick, but it might not.) Explain why you chose that answer.	You can not tell because we do not know the strength of the magnets. If the magnets are weak, the second piece of foam might put too much distance between the 2 magnets for the interaction to hold the magnets in place. If the magnets are strong the magnets might stay in place.	ME.69b.666.1	The magnets might be strong enough to get through the foam blocks or they are not strong enough to get through the foam blocks.	correct
MS_14b	Look at the picture below [which shows a balance tipped down on the side containing a ball; the right cup has 20 grams and 10 grams mass pieces]. The mass of the ball is one of the following. It must be A. 20 grams. B. 30 grams. (C. 40 grams.) Explain why you chose the answer that you did.	There is 30 grams (20 grams plus 10 grams) in the right cup. The balance is tipped down on the ball side which means the ball weighs more than 30 grams. 40 grams is the only weight heavier than 30 grams.	MS.14b.499.1	I chose it because 20 grams plus 10 grams equals 30 grams and the ball is heavier that is why I chose it.	correct
MS_30b	Mary told her friend Sharice that she had a rug to sell. Sharice asked if the rug would fit perfectly, wall to wall, in her bedroom. Mary went home and measured the rug. She put her feet heel-to-toe and counted the number of shoe lengths it took to measure the rug. She found the rug was 18 shoes long and 12 shoes wide. Sharice did the same thing in her room to measure the space for the rug. Her floor was 18 shoes long and 12 shoes wide. A perfect fit! Sharice bought the rug and took it home. To her dismay, she found it was too short and too narrow for her bedroom! What could Mary and Sharice do to better measure the size of the rug?	Use a standard unit of measurement such as centimeters or meters.	MS.30b.381.1	They should use a standard.	correct
SE_48	Maggie wanted to find out if surface area affected temperature change. She had 3 white cake pans. She filled each with 300 milliliters of water. She put one small black plastic disk in pan A, 2 in pan B, and 3 in pan C. Then she put all 3 pans in the sun. When Maggie measured the water temperature in each pan after 15 minutes, which pan do you think held the hottest water? Explain your answer.	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	SE.48.580.1	C. I picked C because A and B only have one or 2 black plastic disks and that does not take as much heat. Also C has more black so it would be hotter because there is more black.	correct
PS_51a	Katie got a guitar for her birthday. She experimented with the strings and found she could change their sounds. One way Katie could change the sound of a string was to tighten it. Describe how the sound was different when the string was tightened.	When the string was tighter, the pitch was higher.	PS.51a.488.1	It is going to sound high. And if it not tightened it going to sound low.	correct
ME_7b	Lee has an object he wants to test to see if it is an insulator or a conductor. He is going to use the circuit you see in the picture. How will he know if the object is a conductor?	If the motor runs, the object is a conductor.	ME.7b.191.1	He could know if it works, motor.	correct
VB_12d	Describe the relationship between the length of the string and the number of swings a swinger makes in 15 seconds.	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	VB.12d.394.1	The longer your string is the less amount of swings you will get.	correct
SE_51b	Look at the 2 solar water heaters shown here. The black triangular area is the solar collector in each container. If both heaters contain the same amount of water, would you expect the temperature change in heater X to be greater than, less than, or the same as the temperature change in heater Y after 30 minutes? (Same) Explain your answer.	The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.	SE.51b.398.1	I think the same because it is the same size, same shape, same color. It is just placed differently in the container which would not have an impact.	correct
EM_27b	You can tell if a rock contains calcite by putting it into a cold acid (like vinegar). Describe what you would observe if you did the acid test on a rock that contains this substance.	Many tiny bubbles will rise from the calcite when the calcite contacts the cold acid.	EM.27b.638.1	It would fizzles.	correct
ME_17c	Denise made a circuit to light a bulb or run a motor. She used a special switch. Below is the schematic diagram of her circuit. The switch is inside the dotted box. What will happen when she moves the switch to the right?	The motor will run.	ME.17c.108.1	It will work.	correct
EM_16b	Ms. Teridann, a geologist, made a chart showing the scratch-test data for 3 minerals (Mineral X, Mineral Y, and Mineral Z). She wrote "yes" if the tool scratched the mineral and wrote "no" if it did not scratch it. Topaz is a mineral that cannot be scratched by a fingernail, a penny, or a paperclip. How hard is topaz compared to minerals X, Y, and Z? Explain how you know.	Topaz would be the hardest of the 4 minerals because none of the tools could scratch topaz and at least one tool could scratch each of the other minerals.	EM.16b.456.1	Topaz is harder than X, Y, and Z. Because it could not get scratched by the tools.	correct
SE_48	Maggie wanted to find out if surface area affected temperature change. She had 3 white cake pans. She filled each with 300 milliliters of water. She put one small black plastic disk in pan A, 2 in pan B, and 3 in pan C. Then she put all 3 pans in the sun. When Maggie measured the water temperature in each pan after 15 minutes, which pan do you think held the hottest water? Explain your answer.	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	SE.48.556.1	C. Because it has the most black disks. Black absorbs heat.	correct
MX_52b	Emily put 20 milliliters of a mystery solution in an evaporation dish. When all the water was gone, she drew the picture of the dish you see here.  Using the crystal-shape key below, what chemical do you think was dissolved in the solution? A. Epsom salt B. Sodium thiosulfate (C. Alum) D. None of the above. Explain why you chose that answer.	Emily's crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals shown on the key.	MX.52b.607.1	Because below the alum picture looks just like the one above.	correct
SE_47b	Sue bought a white wading pool for her grandchildren. She wanted to heat up the water as fast as possible. She thought that if she put plastic sheeting in the bottom of the pool it might heat up the water faster. She had a sheet of yellow plastic and a sheet of dark green plastic. What should Sue do to heat the water as fast as possible? A. Put the yellow sheeting on the bottom of the pool. (B. Put the dark green sheeting on the bottom of the pool.) C. Put no sheeting on the bottom of the pool; leave it white. Explain why you chose that answer.	Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.	SE.47b.532.1	Because darker colors heat up faster.	correct
ME_17b	Denise made a circuit to light a bulb or run a motor off a D-cell battery. She used a special switch. Below is the schematic diagram of her circuit. The switch is inside the dotted box. Why will the bulb light when she moves the switch to the left?	There is a complete circuit connecting the bulb to the D-cell battery.	ME.17b.119.1	That will happen because it is a complete circuit.	correct
FN_17c	Paula wants to test a food to see if it contains acid and/or sugar. When Paula added water and yeast to a sample of the food and put the mixture in a warm water bath, the mixture began to fizz and bubble. Paula tested for the other substance. What would the test results tell her?	If gas (carbon dioxide) is produced, the food contains acid. If no gas is produced, the food does not contain acid.	FN.17c.410.1	Well if it has a lot of volume it has sugar and if the syringe goes all the way up it has acid.	correct
II_24b	Design a way to use carbon printing to find out if 2 Labrador retrievers have the same paw patterns. How will you know if the 2 dogs have paw patterns that are the same?	Compare prints to see if the patterns are the same.	II.24b.405.1	Look really carefully at the paper and see if it is the same.	correct
MX_11f	Jim used a solid and water to make Mixtures one (one spoon of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with nothing on the bottom), 3 (3 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with nothing on the bottom), 4 (4 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with material on the bottom), and 5 (5 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with material on the bottom) as shown below. He stirred each one and observed the results. If Jim made Mixture 2 with 2 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters of water, what would he observe? What evidence do you have to support this?	Jim would see a clear solution. 3 spoons of solid dissolves, so 2 spoons will dissolve.	MX.11f.393.1	Clear with nothing on the bottom because one is clear with nothing on the bottom and 3 is the same.	correct
FN_17a	Paula wants to test a food to see if it contains acid and/or sugar. When Paula added water and yeast to a sample of the food and put the mixture in a warm water bath, the mixture began to fizz and bubble. What does this chemical reaction indicate?	The food contains sugar.	FN.17a.143.1	She is doing a sugar test.	correct
PS_44	A harp has strings of different lengths. Describe how the sound of a short string being plucked (pulled and let go quickly) is different from the sound of a long string being plucked.	If the string is shorter, the pitch will be higher. If the string is longer, the pitch will be lower.	PS.44.145.1	The short string has a higher pitch sound.	correct
LF_34b	Draw an arrow to show which direction the water flows in the river. (Rose Mountain is on the left and Happy Valley is on the right in the drawing.) Why do you think the water flows in that direction?	Water will always flow downhill (mountain to valley).	LF.34b.825.1	I believe it flows in that direction because the earth water comes out of cracks in mountain a flow down the mountain and into river.	correct
LF_31b	What process forms deltas? A. Gravity B. Erosion (C. Deposition) D. Decomposition.  Explain how deltas form.	Earth materials erode and are carried by flowing water (a river). The earth materials form a delta when the materials are dropped off or deposited when the water stops flowing (at the mouth of a river).	LF.31b.526.1	Deltas are formed by erosion and deposition.	incorrect
ME_10	The motors shown at the right with the D-cell batteries will NOT run. Explain why.	The negative terminals of the D-cell batteries are facing each other, so there is no flow of electricity.	ME.10.214.1	The motors will not run because they do not have negative they only have positives.	incorrect
EM_48b	Emily evaporated a solution and drew a picture of the crystals that remained. Using the crystal-shape key below, what was dissolved in the solution? A. Epsom salt (B. alum) C. sodium thiosulfate.  Explain why you chose that answer.	The crystals are the same shape as the alum crystals.	EM.48b.399.1	Because the minerals on the top look just the same as alum on the bottom.	incorrect
EM_45c	You used several methods to separate and identify the substances in mock rocks. How did you know the crystals were salt?	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	EM.45c.396.1	We know the crystals were salt because we identified them.	incorrect
FN_24c	Diva's father told her she should not eat so many cookies because they were pure sugar. Diva decided to investigate the amount of sugar in Fruity Cream cookies. She performed the sugar test on 4 grams of pure sugar and on 4 grams of Fruity Cream cookies. The results are pictured at the right. Why did Diva need to test pure sugar?	Diva needs to know how much gas pure sugar produced in order to decide whether the cookies are pure sugar. Diva needs to make a controlled experiment.	FN.24c.293.1	To see if Fruity Cream cookies are full of sugar like her father said.	incorrect
SE_22c	Andi and Scott decided to investigate solar water heaters using collectors of different colors (but the same size) as one variable and covered versus uncovered as a second variable. Look at the graph of their data and answer the questions below. Why would comparing only the red uncovered heater with the blue covered heater not provide useful information?	When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.	SE.22c.527.1	Because blue goes so high and red goes so low you cannot tell anything.	incorrect
MX_22a	A solution is a type of mixture. What makes it different from other mixtures?	A solution is a mixture formed when a solid dissolves in a liquid.	MX.22a.541.1	Different items.	incorrect
II_20b	When Sarah did the chromatography test, she saw that one black ink stayed black and didn't separate. She discovered that she had used a permanent marker. She wondered what would happen if she used a different liquid. She wrote in her science notebook, What if I used vinegar in place of the water? Can I get the pigments in permanent ink to separate? How will Sarah know if vinegar separated the permanent ink?	Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.	II.20b.533.1	We try it and it work.	incorrect
SE_45	Betty was puzzled. In the morning the shadow of the bus sign is in the street. In the afternoon the shadow of the bus sign points the opposite direction. Explain to Betty why this happens.	In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.	SE.45.561.1	The earth rotates.	incorrect
MS_39	Why is it important to use a standard unit when making a measurement?	So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.	MS.39.115.1	Because you could not make measurement without a standard unit.	incorrect
SE_31b	Julie and David each built a solar water heater. Both solar water heaters were 10 centimeters x 10 centimeters x 30 centimeters. Both water heaters were painted black on the inside bottom and filled to the top with 3 liters of room temperature water. Both water heaters were set in the sun. They checked the temperatures every 5 minutes and made the table below. Which box did Julie build, A or B? What evidence supports your answer?	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	SE.31b.530.1	B. Because in B, it is long and it hold more heat.	incorrect
ME_30	Sometimes a red stoplight changes to green only when a car stops at the light. A type of magnet hidden under the surface of the road triggers the light to turn green. What is it about the car that could trigger a magnet to send a signal to the light?	A car is made of a lot of iron or steel.	ME.30.247.1	There is a magnet that turns the color of the signal light that makes it turn red, yellow, green.	incorrect
PS_2a	Why does a rubber band make a sound when you pluck it (pull and let go quickly)?	The rubber band vibrates.	PS.2a.331.1	Because it is made rubber.	incorrect
ME_38a	Trace over the complete circuit with your pencil to show where it is. Even though there is a complete circuit, the bulb will not light. Why not?	The circuit does not include both contact points on the bulb holder, so the electricity can not go through the bulb.	ME.38a.192.1	The bulb will not light because there is a closed circuit.	incorrect
EM_21b	Georgia found one brown mineral and one black mineral. How will she know which one is harder?	The harder mineral will leave a scratch on the less hard mineral. If the black mineral is harder, the brown mineral will have a scratch.	EM.21b.252.1	The one that starts to gather.	incorrect
MS_50a	Jen was talking on the phone with her Uncle Bill who lives in Canada. When she asked him how the weather was, he said it was nice and warm, about 28 degrees. What unit is Uncle Bill using to report the temperature?	Bill must have been using degrees Celsius if 28 is a warm temperature.	MS.50a.496.1	Thermometer.	incorrect
II_20b	When Sarah did the chromatography test, she saw that one black ink stayed black and didn't separate. She discovered that she had used a permanent marker. She wondered what would happen if she used a different liquid. She wrote in her science notebook, What if I used vinegar in place of the water? Can I get the pigments in permanent ink to separate? How will Sarah know if vinegar separated the permanent ink?	Seeing multiple colors would show that vinegar can separate the permanent ink.	II.20b.420.1	She would use filter paper and dip it into water.	incorrect
ME_72	Only one circuit below will light the bulb. Which one will work? Why is that the only circuit that will work?	That circuit is the only circuit that uses all of the correct contact points.	ME.72.212.1	The only circuit that will work is A.	incorrect
VB_12d	Describe the relationship between the length of the string and the number of swings a swinger makes in 15 seconds.	The shorter the string is, the more the string swings in 15 seconds.  The longer the string is, the less the string swings in 15 seconds.	VB.12d.440.1	Well the longer the string the slower it swings so a 90 centimeters swinger will go very slow compared to a 19 centimeters swinger.	incorrect
II_24b	Design a way to use carbon printing to find out if 2 Labrador retrievers have the same paw patterns. How will you know if the 2 dogs have paw patterns that are the same?	Compare prints to see if the patterns are the same.	II.24b.430.1	Because there is small dogs and huge dogs.	incorrect
MX_11c	Jim used a solid and water to make Mixtures one (one spoon of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with nothing on the bottom), 3 (3 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with nothing on the bottom), 4 (4 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with material on the bottom), and 5 (5 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with material on the bottom) as shown below. He stirred each one and observed the results. Is the concentration of Mixture 5 less than, greater than, or the same as the concentration of Mixture 4? Explain your answer.	The concentrations are the same because both mixtures are saturated.	MX.11c.304.1	Mixture 5 is greater than mixture 4, it had more solid.	incorrect
II_26	Look at the rubbings of 2 different fabrics. What do the rubbings tell us about the different textures of these 2 fabrics?	Fabric A is smoother and has a finer texture. Fabric B is rougher and has a coarser texture.	II.26.434.1	A is like lines and B has squares and lines.	incorrect
LP_15c	What is the relationship between the amount of effort required to lift the load and its distance from the fulcrum?	If the effort is applied farther from the fulcrum, less effort will lift the load.	LP.15c.630.1	If the effort is closer to the fulcrum then it is easier but if the effort is farther from the fulcrum then it is harder.	incorrect
LF_31b	What process forms deltas? A. Gravity B. Erosion (C. Deposition) D. Decomposition.  Explain how deltas form.	Earth materials erode and are carried by flowing water (a river). The earth materials form a delta when the materials are dropped off or deposited when the water stops flowing (at the mouth of a river).	LF.31b.827.1	Deltas form by the water wearing down the mouth and dragging it down.	incorrect
MS_43a	2 groups used marbles to weigh the same apple. Jin's group found the apple weighed 35 marbles and Bee's group found the same apple weighed 60 marbles. Both groups used the correct procedure. Since they weighed the same apple, what do you think happened to make the results different?	The marbles used by the 2 groups were probably different masses.	MS.43a.569.1	They forgot to do some things before they balance.	incorrect
PS_45b	Nathaniel and Sammy are trying to make up a code for sending messages to each other by dropping items in a drop chamber and listening to them. Sammy wants to design a code using blocks made of plastic, metal, and wood. Nathaniel thinks it would be a better idea to use wooden blocks of different sizes and shapes. Which student's method would make it easier to tell the difference between the sounds? Why?	Sammy's. Different materials would make very different sounds. Different size wood would make very similar sounds.	PS.45b.457.1	Nathaniel - Because it has different sounds and metal vibrates more than wood and plastics, plastic is a different material than wood and makes a different sound.	incorrect
SE_31b	Julie and David each built a solar water heater. Both solar water heaters were 10 centimeters x 10 centimeters x 30 centimeters. Both water heaters were painted black on the inside bottom and filled to the top with 3 liters of room temperature water. Both water heaters were set in the sun. They checked the temperatures every 5 minutes and made the table below. Which box did Julie build, A or B? What evidence supports your answer?	A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.	SE.31b.246.1	B. That they both painted black on the inside in the bottom and filled the top with liters of water. And the heaters will set the sun.	incorrect
ME_28b	Look at the picture on the right. Label the poles on each magnet. (The bottom 2 magnets are stuck together, the others are not.) What is the rule that explains why you labeled the poles the way you did?	Like poles repel and opposite poles attract.	ME.28b.xx-27.1	The reason the magnets on the pencil are not touching because of magnetic force.	incorrect
SE_25a	The graph shows temperature data from 2 containers. One container had 100 milliliters of water and the other had 100 milliliters of dry soil. Each container was placed in the sun for 20 minutes and then in the shade for 20 minutes. Which container, A or B, had the dry soil? Explain how the graph helped you decide which container had the dry soil.	A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.	SE.25a.319.1	A. Because it has a higher temperature than water.	incorrect
MS_39	Why is it important to use a standard unit when making a measurement?	So people know exactly what the measurement means. A standard is necessary so everyone measures using the same unit and everyone gets the same measurement.	MS.39.598.1	We use a standard unit so we do not get the measurement wrong.	incorrect
EM_35	Carrie wanted to find out which was harder, a penny or a nickel, so she did a scratch test. How would this tell her which is harder?	The harder coin will scratch the other.	EM.35.521.1	Find the more harder metal and the rock and penny is harder and see it want is harder.	incorrect
