EM_45b	You used several methods to separate and identify the substances in mock rocks. How did you separate the salt from the water?	The water was evaporated, leaving the salt.	EM.45b.452.1	We kept the salt in the vial and put the water in the Petri dish.	incorrect
EM_45b	You used several methods to separate and identify the substances in mock rocks. How did you separate the salt from the water?	The water was evaporated, leaving the salt.	EM.45b.533.1	Get all the water out.	incorrect
EM_45c	You used several methods to separate and identify the substances in mock rocks. How did you know the crystals were salt?	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	EM.45c.340.1	Well because we broke them apart.	incorrect
EM_45c	You used several methods to separate and identify the substances in mock rocks. How did you know the crystals were salt?	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	EM.45c.385.1	By looking very closely at it.	incorrect
EM_45c	You used several methods to separate and identify the substances in mock rocks. How did you know the crystals were salt?	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	EM.45c.396.1	We know the crystals were salt because we identified them.	incorrect
EM_45c	You used several methods to separate and identify the substances in mock rocks. How did you know the crystals were salt?	The crystals were square with Xs on the surface.	EM.45c.645.1	Because I look at the chart.	incorrect
EM_16b	Ms. Teridann, a geologist, made a chart showing the scratch-test data for 3 minerals (Mineral X, Mineral Y, and Mineral Z). She wrote "yes" if the tool scratched the mineral and wrote "no" if it did not scratch it. Topaz is a mineral that cannot be scratched by a fingernail, a penny, or a paperclip. How hard is topaz compared to minerals X, Y, and Z? Explain how you know.	Topaz would be the hardest of the 4 minerals because none of the tools could scratch topaz and at least one tool could scratch each of the other minerals.	EM.16b.439.1	Topaz is most like mineral Z because Topaz cannot be scratched by anything and mineral Z can only be scratched by one thing.	correct

Topaz would be the hardest of the 4 minerals because none of the tools could scratch topaz and at least one tool could scratch each of the other minerals.	EM.16b.456.1	Topaz is harder than X, Y, and Z. Because it could not get scratched by the tools.	correct
