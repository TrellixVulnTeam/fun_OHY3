ME_79	Kurt was investigating which objects stick to magnets. He made an entry in his science notebook and drew a picture to help explain what he did. Look what I did! I picked up a paperclip with a magnet. Then that paperclip picked up another one, and then another one. And they weren't hooked together either. All they had to do was touch each other. Explain to Kurt why he was able to pick up all those paperclips, even though the magnet was only touching the first one.	When a paperclip sticks to a magnet, the paperclip turns into a temporary magnet, so the paperclip can stick to other paperclips and other things made of iron.	ME.79.327.1	It is an induced magnetism.	incorrect

Nigel took 50 milliliters of solution from bottle A and put it in cup A and 50 milliliters of solution from bottle B and put it into cup B. He put the cups on each side of the balance. Which picture shows what would happen? A is heavier than B, B is heavier than A, (A and B are the same weight). Explain your choice.	The solutions have the same concentration (2 spoons in 50 milliliters is the same as 4 spoons in 100 milliliters) so the mass would also be the same.	MX.46b.385.1	Because they are equally concentrated and they both have some of water.	incorrect

When equal amounts of 2 solutions are compared, the solution that is more concentrated will have the greater mass (weigh more). 50 milliliters of X has a greater mass than 50 milliliters of Y, so X must be more concentrated.	MX.49.392.1	Y, I think y because x just because it is heavier does not mean that that is more concentrated. I think it means it is less concentrated because there is more room the more water the more room.	incorrect

SE_47b	Sue bought a white wading pool for her grandchildren. She wanted to heat up the water as fast as possible. She thought that if she put plastic sheeting in the bottom of the pool it might heat up the water faster. She had a sheet of yellow plastic and a sheet of dark green plastic. What should Sue do to heat the water as fast as possible? A. Put the yellow sheeting on the bottom of the pool. (B. Put the dark green sheeting on the bottom of the pool.) C.
