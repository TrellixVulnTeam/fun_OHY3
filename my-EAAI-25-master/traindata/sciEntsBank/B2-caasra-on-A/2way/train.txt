Do the 2 saturated solutions have the same concentration? Explain your answer.	Yes. If both solutions are saturated (and at the same temperature), the solutions will both have the same concentration. Once a solution is saturated, the solution cannot get any more concentrated.	MX.16a.644.1	No because Richard has way more solution than Mariella so it is not the same amount.	incorrect
MX_46b	Nigel made solutions in the bottles as shown below. Solution A was 2 spoons solute in 50 milliliters water and was clear with no material on the bottom. Solution B was 4 spoons solute in 100 milliliters water and was clear with no material on the bottom.

Because there is more black tarp and under Julie it has higher temperatures. And more black heats up faster so Julie's is A.	correct
SE_31b	Julie and David each built a solar water heater. Both solar water heaters were 10 centimeters x 10 centimeters x 30 centimeters. Both water heaters were painted black on the inside bottom and filled to the top with 3 liters of room temperature water. Both water heaters were set in the sun. They checked the temperatures every 5 minutes and made the table below. Which box did Julie build, A or B? What evidence supports your answer?	A.

Pan C had the largest surface area to absorb the heat from the sun, so pan C became the warmest pan in the sun.	correct
SE_48	Maggie wanted to find out if surface area affected temperature change. She had 3 white cake pans. She filled each with 300 milliliters of water. She put one small black plastic disk in pan A, 2 in pan B, and 3 in pan C. Then she put all 3 pans in the sun. When Maggie measured the water temperature in each pan after 15 minutes, which pan do you think held the hottest water? Explain your answer.	C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.	SE.48.430.1	C. Well it has more black, and the sun's heat is attracted by dark colors, so the heat would stay on C.	incorrect

Which student's method would make it easier to tell the difference between the sounds? Why?	Sammy - Sammy's method because if we use wood blocks of different sizes then some of the block could sound the same and wood, metal, plastic sound different.	PS.45b.595.1	Sammy - Because you can tell the difference of metal, plastic, and wood. You know it is ding for metal and bom for plastic and hock for wood.	incorrect

They painted the plastic containers black, filled each with the same amount of water, and put a clear plastic lid on each one. Then they set them out in the sunshine. Here are the data that Cory and Rachael collected: After 10 minutes Container A was 3 degrees Celsius, Container B was 9 degrees Celsius, and Container C was 12 degrees Celsius. Use the graph paper on the next page to graph the temperature change for each container. If Cory and Rachael had a container that was the same height and width as the other containers, but 20 centimeters long, what do you think the temperature change would be after 10 minutes? (6 Celsius) How did you decide what the temperature change would be for the new container?	If the container is 20 centimeters in width the temperature should be between the 10 centimeters container and the 30 centimeters container.	SE.16b2.496.1	I chose 6 Celsius because you would be counting by 3's if there was a 20 centimeters long, because the length of each container was counting by 10's.	correct
